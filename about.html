<p>For the uninitiated, AK&Oslash;A is my FCC issued <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio">amateur radio</a> callsign. Amateur radio is a radiocommunication service for the purpose of self-training, intercommunication and technical investigations carried out by amateurs, that is, duly authorized persons interested in radio technique solely with a personal aim and without pecuniary interest. I first became interested in "radio" at a young age, having grown up near an AM broadcast station that shared it's frequency with the former legendary border blaster, <a href="http://www.ominous-valve.com/xerf.html">XERF</a>. I found long distance radio propagation to be nothing short of magic. My parents fostered my interests with radios and <a href="https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/science-fair-160-electronic-project-1827243716">electronic project kits</a>. Grandmothers gave me Part 15 walkie-talkies. Family friends loaned me antique tube shortwave receivers. In the early 1980's, I stumbled upon two hams having a conversation on 40 meters - AM. I clearly recall an engineer for WGN in Chicago was talking to another ham in California. I've been hooked ever since. With the help of my <a href="https://qsl.net/w0gcj">local radio club</a>, I obtained my Novice License (Originally licensed in 1985 as KA&Oslash;VSZ). With the help of my dad, I obtained my novice rig, a used <a href="https://www.universal-radio.com/catalog/hamhf/ts520.html">Kenwood TS-520</a>. I quickly followed with upgrades to Technician and General in 1986. College took priority for a few years, but I achieved my Advanced and Amateur Extra class licenses prior to the Y2K license restructuring. My current interests include DX-ing (with CW DXCC and individual DXCC awards on 7 bands, so far), contesting, traffic handling, emergency preparedness/communications Raspberry Pi and Linux on the ham radio desktop. </p>
