Above normal daily high temperatures lingered across the southern Plains during the drought week, but light freezes and frost were reported late in the week as far south as west-central Kansas. Deterioration in dryness and drought was noted in north-central and northeast Kansas. The latest U.S. Seasonal Drought Outlook released last week indicates that above-normal temperatures and below-normal precipitation are favored throughout the last quarter of the year with increased odds for widespread drought development across the Central and Southern Plains. While much of the region has experienced a mix of improving and deteriorating conditions, many areas still did not receive enough rainfall to offset longer-term deficits for drought-stricken areas. In addition, the High Plains states are entering into a climatologically dry time of year and frozen season. Given the general lack of wet signals, drought persistence is favored for much of the current drought region. Also released last week, NOAAâ€™s Climate Prediction Center issued their U.S. Winter Outlook. According to the outlook, Kansas will likely see a warmer than normal winter season this year.
