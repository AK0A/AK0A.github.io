<br>The TI9M DXpedition to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocos_Island">Cocos Island</a>, which happened in February 2002, made more than 80,000 contacts. Over 20 years later, I still receive occasional QSL requests for this operation, which is a testament to the DXpedition's enduring legacy. TI9 remains on many top-100 lists of <a href="https://clublog.org/mostwanted.php">most wanted DXCC entities</a>. The QSL manager for the 2002 DXpedition was Bill Boeckenhaupt, who became a <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/119861541/william-frederick-boeckenhaupt">silent key in 2017</a>. K&Oslash;JN who verified the card above also became a <href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/212728102/joseph-francis-nemecek">silent key in 2020</a>. While I am unable to assit with your QSL requests, another member of the TI9M DXpedition who has access to the February 2002 logs and has been very helpful with resolving these matters is <a href="https://qrz.com/db/F5CWU">F5CWU</a>. An active stateside member of the DXpedition is <a href="https://qrz.com/db/K0KKO">K&Oslash;KKO</a>. Additional members of the 2002 DXpedition can be <a href="https://www.qsl.net/ti2hmg/cocosmembers.htm">found here</a>.
