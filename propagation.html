Monthly predictions such as those above have been watched closely since the dawn of the world wide web. Although Dr. Hathaway retired in December, 2016, he continues to publish his monthly predictions at his own website <a href="http://solarcyclescience.com">http://solarcyclescience.com</a>. Some solar physists believe the Sun is in the process of crossing into its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2016/06/27/sun-has-likely-entered-new-evolutionary-phase-say-astronomers/#164d5330278e">magnetic middle age</a>, where its 11-year Sunspot cycles will slowly disappear entirely, with few (if any) sunspots or coronal mass ejections. Now, if only we could boil up one more <a href="https://eos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019RG000645-Figure-6-sized-for-Eos-full-width-800.png">Cycle 19</a>.</p>
