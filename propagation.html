Some solar physists believe the Sun is in the process of crossing into its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2016/06/27/sun-has-likely-entered-new-evolutionary-phase-say-astronomers/#164d5330278e">magnetic middle age</a>, where its 11-year Sunspot cycles will slowly disappear entirely, with few (if any) sunspots or coronal mass ejections. Now, if only we could boil up one more <a href="https://eos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019RG000645-Figure-6-sized-for-Eos-full-width-800.png">Cycle 19</a>.</p>
